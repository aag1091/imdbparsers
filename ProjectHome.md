The Internet Movie Database provides its database to the public, but only in its own formats. This project hosts parsers to convert this information to standard formats like XML and SQL.

See also: some tools already exist (Alternative Interfaces at imdb.com/interfaces), which allow you to query specific information.

Note: as of Jan 2010, parsers in this project only exist for a subset of the information in the imdb db.
